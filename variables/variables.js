// Undefined: it is a variable with an undefined value.
// Null: it is a variable with a value defined as null.

// let: It is a keyword in JavaScript used to declare variables. 'let' allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of the block, statement, or expression where they are used.

// var: It is the older way of declaring variables in JavaScript. A variable declared with 'var' is defined throughout the program that contains it, meaning it has function scope.

// const: It is used to declare a variable whose value cannot be changed after it is initially set. This means that once you assign a value to a 'const' variable, you cannot reassign a new value to it.
